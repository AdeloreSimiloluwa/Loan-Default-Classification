# Loan-Default-Classification
Data Science Class Project

Defaulting on a loan happens when repayments aren't made for a certain period. Defaulting will drastically reduce your credit score, impact your ability to receive future credit, and can lead to the seizure of personal property (vehicle). The probability of default, sometimes abbreviated as POD or PD, expresses the likelihood the borrower will not maintain the financial capability to make scheduled debt payments. There are several major variables to consider: the financial health of the borrower; the severity of the consequences of a default for the borrower and the creditor; the size of the credit extension; historical trends in default rates; and a variety of macroeconomic considerations. 

**The objective of the project is to classify loan defulters and non defauls and predict whether a person is likely to default on a loan of not.**
